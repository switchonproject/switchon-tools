### Task 2.3 Toolset (Lead: DELTARES)
T2.3 will develop common tools which facilitate the use of the platform data and data derivatives. The data which
will be used, stored and retrieved may have many different shapes, forms and come from different backgrounds,
therefore common tools will be defined for the used types of data. Regular operations applied to times series and
gridded data will be supported. If a dedicated data operation is requested from different WPs it can be decided
to add this functionality to an existing Toolset Package; 1) Statistical packageâ€“ data-analysis and statistical
methods applicable to both scalar (timeseries) data and spatial data. Statistical operations to derive (spatial)
minimum, maximum and average values, aggregation methods both in time and space (horizontal, vertical) etc.;
2) Visualisation package. Using map, graph and tabular components to visualise data in a clear way, making
sure that the user can adjust colour rendering and other adjustments for proper data visualisation; 3) Export and
Reporting package. The user will be able to use the tools in this package to export (meta) data into commonly
used formats like WaterML2, NetCDF, XML, CSV, other formats or publish reports out of the data available on
the platform (png, jpg, pdf etc.); 4) Custom Operations package. Based on specific questions from other WPs
(mainly WP3 and WP4) specific algorithms/data modifications will be added to one of the available packages. All
partners from WP3 and WP4 will be involved in this activity.
Input: The spatial information platform from T2.1. and functionality from T2.2. User requirements from T3.1and
T6.2.

Output: Functionality to explore open datasets statistically and visually, to export the data to different formats
and data transformation, i.e. tailoring for specific use. Delivered to T3.1, 3.3-7, and T4.2
